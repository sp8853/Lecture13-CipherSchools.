questions:
what happens when we add integers to pointers 
what is scale factor
if we know the addition of the first element in an array , can we make a set ?


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int a=5;
int *x;
x=&a;
cout<<"the address of a , which is stored in the ponter x is:"<<x<<"the value of x+1 is "<<x+1 is 
}
